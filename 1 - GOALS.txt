The goal of this app is to create a simple "social media" application where:
    - A user can register (✔)
    - A user can login (✔)
    - The front-end is React (✔)
    - The back-end is PHP (✔)
    - The database is MySQL (✔)
    - The users can put interests in their profile and the backend will group them with other users with the same interests

    Main
    - Get user details from Sign In (✔)
    - Shows people with same interests

    Main Nav
    - Logout (✔)
    - Go To Profile (✔)
    - Search (Opt)

    Profile
    - Ability to add interests
    - Ability to add "bio", profile picture and other details
    - Ability to connect to FB, Twitter, Google, etc. (Opt)

What I want to learn while doing this:
    - More practice on React (✔)
    - Redux (X) => Not needed anymore as it will only add much more complexity
    - CSS-in-JS => Styled-Components (✔)
    - PHP (✔)
    - Fetch API (✔)
    - React Router (✔)
