The goal of this app is to create a simple "social media" application where:
    - A user can register
    - A user can login
    - The front-end is React
    - The back-end is PHP
    - The database is MySQL
    - The users can put interests in their profile and the backend will group them with other users with the same interests

What I want to learn while doing this:
    - More practice on React
    - Redux
    - CSS-in-JS => Styled-Components (âœ”)
    - PHP
    - Fetch API
    - React Router
